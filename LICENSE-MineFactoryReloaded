Free for non-commercial use. You are free to include any of these mods in any modpacks or server-specific packs 
without needing to ask permission (but it'd be nice to hear if you do!), provided something either in the download or 
on your site lists me as the creator. You are also free to produce Bukkit ports. A link to this thread would be nice 
for any of the above, but that's all I ask.

You also have implied permission to build mods that depend on PowerCrystalsCore, if you want some of the 
functionality in there.
